- raffle winner before X seconds?
- can anyone beside the winner get the NFT?
- can anyone beside the owner set the feeAddress?
- when can the owner take a cut?
- can parts call refund after the raffle period is over?
- does the raffle operate in rounds, where X is the interval of the round? during this round the parts can enter via tickets and during this process the owner can withdraw a portion of this ticket value and parts can also refund their tickets but at the end of the interval the winner gets all teh value + the NFT?
