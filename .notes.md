```js
    function testIsDoS() public {
        vm.txGasPrice(1);
        address[] memory players = new address[](100);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }

        uint256 gasUsedBefore = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 100}(players);
        uint256 gasUsedAfter = gasleft();
        uint256 gasUsed = (gasUsedBefore - gasUsedAfter) * tx.gasprice;

        console.log("Gas used for first 100: ", gasUsed);

        address[] memory players2 = new address[](100);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            players2[i] = address(i + players.length);
        }

        uint256 gasUsedBefore2 = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 100}(players2);
        uint256 gasUsedAfter2 = gasleft();
        uint256 gasUsed2 = (gasUsedBefore2 - gasUsedAfter2) * tx.gasprice;

        console.log("Gas used for second 100: ", gasUsed2);

        assert(gasUsed2 > gasUsed);
    }

```

the gas paid by the second 100 players is much more than the first 100 
> Gas used for first 100:  6252039
  Gas used for second 100:  18068129

- Found a Reentrancy Attack Vector

**Impact** : High 

## Medium-High

- Weak Randomness in the `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` method; random numbers are being produced by deterministic figures or influenceable figures like block.difficulty by miners

**Impact**: M/H








# Attack Vectors
- can we add duplicate parts?
- can we enter the raffle without a ticket?
- what if users couldn't get a refund?
- raffle winner before X seconds?
- can anyone beside the winner get the NFT?
- can anyone beside the owner set the feeAddress?
- when can the owner take a cut?
- can parts call refund after the raffle period is over?
- does the raffle operate in rounds, where X is the interval of the round? during this round the parts can enter via tickets and during this process the owner can withdraw a portion of this ticket value and parts can also refund their tickets but at the end of the interval the winner gets all teh value + the NFT?
